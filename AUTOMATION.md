# 🤖 Family Hub Automation

This describes how I process family group messages.

## Message Processing Rules

**Shopping Items** (→ shopping.md)
- Trigger words: buy, get, need, shopping, grocery, store
- Examples: "buy milk", "need eggs", "get bread at store"
- Action: Add to "To Buy" section with checkbox

**Tasks** (→ tasks.md)
- Trigger words: todo, task, remember to, don't forget, need to
- Examples: "remember to call plumber", "task: fix door"
- Action: Add to "Todo" section with checkbox

**Events** (→ calendar.md)
- Trigger: Date/time mentions
- Examples: "dentist Tuesday 3pm", "movie night Friday", "birthday party next Saturday"
- Action: Add to appropriate section with date

**Notes** (→ notes.md)
- Everything else: ideas, information, reminders
- Examples: "WiFi password is...", "good restaurant: ...", "vacation idea: ..."

## Voice Messages

I can transcribe voice messages and process them the same way!

## Queries

Ask me anything:
- "What's on the shopping list?"
- "What's happening this week?"
- "What tasks are pending?"
- "Mark eggs as bought"
- "Complete task: call plumber"
